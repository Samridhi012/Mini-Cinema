Hi friends!
I have tried my hands on something inspired by "Pinterest".I created a webpage called "MINI CINEMA" which presents to you scenes of some iconic bollywood movies. 
This project is HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT based. Where HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage, CSS styles this webpage and the images, and finally Javascript adds the images dynamically to the webpage.
I have used CSS GRID to layout pictures and these pictures appear on webpage using Javascript instead of using multiple <div>.
This was a great experience trying on the frontend.
Happy learning!
